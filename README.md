# ISE-Extra

This is some extra extensive feature that can be implented in the SimiLabs project. 

Keep in mind:
  This code only works with word documents
  A existing folder with word documents is needed.
  
What does it do?

  - Creates a folder within the corpus with all the documents converted to a txt file.
  - Creates a folder for the model that is used to calculate the similarities.
  - Add the suspected document to the corpus.
